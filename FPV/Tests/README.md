If a file is empty here it's because the tests are not required. 
Tests not required??? what blasphemy. I hear you say...
No no. It's because some classes, like box, just have the same rules as the base
classes and os rules so no matter what combo you use, the tests would be the same.
So in this case we can just make placeholder files until there comes a time to write
tests for that service's class.
